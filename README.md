# pomo-timer
A web-based Pomodoro timer designed to help users maintain productivity by using the Pomodoro technique. It employs the concept of 25-minute focused work sessions, followed by 5-minute breaks. After four such intervals, a longer break is taken. This application is based off of an older version of my current pomo-collab project, which adds the potential for synchronized timer sessions, allowing friends or colleagues to work together in harmony.

## Features:
- Pause & Reset: Any party can pause the timer or reset it to start afresh.
- Alerts: Notifications to inform the user when a session ends and a break begins.

## Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone pomodoro-collab

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd pomodoro-collab

3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the application.
